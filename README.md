# SafeGuard AI

SafeGuard AI is a decentralized DeFi risk analysis platform that protects investors from rug pulls and scams using 0G's AI infrastructure. By leveraging 0G Compute for TEE-verified AI inference and 0G Storage for transparent audit trails, SafeGuard delivers real-time smart contract risk assessments at 96% lower cost than traditional cloud AI.

## 🔍 Key Features

- **AI-powered smart contract vulnerability scanning** using 0G DeepSeek V3
- **TEE-verified analysis** ensuring cryptographic proof of results
- **Decentralized storage** of risk scores on 0G Chain for transparency
- **Pattern matching** against known rug pulls and scam indicators
- **Real-time risk scoring** across multiple factors (contract security, token distribution, liquidity, team transparency)

## 💡 Why SafeGuard AI?

Traditional DeFi audits are expensive ($10K-$50K) and slow. SafeGuard AI democratizes security by providing instant, AI-powered risk analysis powered by 0G's decentralized infrastructure at a fraction of the cost.
